# ToDo

- Currently plots adapt brightness. Maybe a switch would be nice between normalizing brightness and not normalizing it would be good.
- Retrieval button should ask for file (open pop up window to select)
- add symmetrize option
- install a save as seed option
- Add ptychographic algorithm as option
- Create input for the center wavelength
